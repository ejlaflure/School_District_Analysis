# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of school district grades using Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook in order to organize the data more efficiently. 

## Project Overview
Deliverables requested for the analysis of the school district: 
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting metrics for: 
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools:
    - Overall passing rate
    - The average scores received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School Performance
    - Budget per student
    - School size
    - Type of school

## Challenge Overview
The grades of the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been changed. After assessing the situation with the school superintendent and Maria, you decide the best approach is to:
- Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
- Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact.

The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
- Replace the incorrect values with NaN.
- Explain how your PyCitySchools analysis changes after you handle the incorrect data.  

## Challenge Summary
Recreate the district and school summary DataFrames.
- How is the district summary affected?

- How is the school summary affected?

Recalculate the high- and low-performing schools.
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?

Recalculate the scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?
  - Math and Reading Scores by Grade
  
  - Scores by School Spending
  
  - Scores by School Size
  
  - Scores by School Type
