# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of school district grades using Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook in order to organize the data more efficiently. 

## Project Overview
Deliverables requested for the analysis of the school district: 
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting metrics for: 
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools:
    - Overall passing rate
    - The average scores received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School Performance
    - Budget per student
    - School size
    - Type of school

## Challenge Overview
The grades of the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been changed. After assessing the situation with the school superintendent and Maria, you decide the best approach is to:
- Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
- Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact.

The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
- Replace the incorrect values with NaN.
- Explain how your PyCitySchools analysis changes after you handle the incorrect data.  

## Challenge Summary
Post grade correction analysis:

- Effect on District Summary
  - Looking at a broad summary of data like this, only a slight change is noticeable.  The average math score went down 0.1, while all three percentages went down 1%. 
- Effect on School Summary
  - 
- Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to the other schools in district
  - 
- Effect on Math and Reading Scores by Grade
  - 
- Effect on Scores by School Spending
  - 
- Effect on Scores by School Size
  - 
- Effect on Scores by School Type
  -
