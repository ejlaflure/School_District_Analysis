## Challenge Overview
The grades of the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been changed. After assessing the situation with the school superintendent and Maria, you decide the best approach is to:
- Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
- Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact.

The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
- Replace the incorrect values with NaN.
- Explain how your PyCitySchools analysis changes after you handle the incorrect data.
